# URL-classification-and-generate-daily-usage-pattern
# This is a project from SUTD Data & Business Analytics subject where I worked in a team of 5 students to find a way to classify URLs under IAB categories and gain insights about users' behaviour based on only their browsing history. I personally focused on preprocessing the dataset we received from the company and web-scraping the URLs.
